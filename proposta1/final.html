          <p id="mem">This 50 second video presents us with a splitscreen of reflections pojected by a small flash ligh on a small area of water creating beautiful imaginative shapes on the wall. With the two videos in diferent rythmic ways, the viewer can focus more in one at the time, giving space for maximum visual thinking. In this video I try to tell my story of jumping into the abstract world of shapes.
With the meaning of the audio and it’s stereo editing, I hope to make the viewer enter this void, immersing in this experience that I consider part of me; in a way, embarking the viewer into a world I call my own.</p>
