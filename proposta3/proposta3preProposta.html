      <p class="memo">For the production of the video I intend to use a Canon 700D Camera with a Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM Lens for a smaller depth of field and overall closer shot, set on a Handheld Steadycam Video Stabilizer or a Tripod; the subject of the video is Joana, the main character, who, on beat with the music throughout the video, keeps interacting with the environment and objects around her.<br>
          The space set for the video is a living room (initial thought), although the objects taking part in the interaction are still being thought upon, whether the storyline represents some sort of character routine, specific activity or a moment caught in the character’s life.

    <p class="descrip"><span id="name">The Blaze - Virile</span> <br>The Blaze always seem to amaze me with their songs' videoclips that they —Jonathan and Guillaume Alric— themselves direct. They use the song's tempo to create a visual rhythm on the characteres moves and gestures that grabs the viewer's attention.<br> The video presents two males interacting in a room, keeping us intrigued on the type of their relationship</p>

    <p class="descrip"><span id="name">The Blaze - Territory</span> <br>The Blaze once again. Like the previous video, we follow a journey of one main character —surrounded by other people throughout the video—, with gestures and movements on beat with the audio. The introductory part of the video is probablly the part that leaves us thinking more. Who is this man? Where is he going? Where is is coming from? Who are these people around? </p>

    <p class="descrip"><span id="name">Bonobo - Kerala</span> <br>This well timed and cut video takes on the journey of the main character, who, for a normal person, would look like a "crazy" woman, seeing things happening around her. This journey is given to us on quite a slow pace, with only 3 shots with the original length of 1 minute and 45 seconds, whereas the final video has 4 minutes and 4 seconds based on the multiple cuts spread throughout the video on beat, returning a small time measurement back in the video. Besides the beautiful placed cuts, we get into the character's life on this alien-paranoia type with details going on the background, almost "Black-Mirror" like<br>

    <p class="descrip"><span id="name">FINNEAS - I Lost A Friend</span> <br>Directed by Sam Bennett —like many other FINNEAS' videos— this video steps of the rest. With only 1 long take, the video sets its' space on an open field (common for the director on FINNEAS's videos to do, either an open field, mountain, space area with wide shots, or a closed space and black background with more close-up shots), giving us a more moving coreography (that is, with the lack of "day to day" movements) to backup the song and the lyrics</p>
