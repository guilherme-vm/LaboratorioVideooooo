	 	 <p class="teste">During Covid-19, my stay staying at home was intense, even when people were already allowed to go outside, it was, for me, a very rare and special occasion.<br> So when presented with a present theme such as "espaço..." (space), once again, I stayed at home and decided to explore the details of the space i've been "locked in" for the past few months.</p>

 <p class="testee">In these four videos I show those details split in 4 seperate screens. From the most common space within my household —the Living Room—, to the most close and self space —the Bedroom, where my outside connection throughout was made over the window, I capture the essence that brings the pieces together, going over the Kitchen area, and a House Mate's Bedroom, as these past times, thankfully, weren't past alone.</p>
          
           <p class="testee">With my liking for "rythm", I track these spaces with the sound. Where with the help of Stereo Audio, and the ideal setup being 4 seperate screens (one in front of you, one behind you, and one on each side of you) with one speaker each facing towards you, playing the respective soundtrack to the video, creative a more exploratory and immersive exeperience.</p>
